In biological systems, magnesium is a co-foactor for many enzymes including deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and various restriction enzymes. Also plays a role in cell membrane integrity, muscle cell physiology, and nucleic acid structure. Magnesium chloride solution is a favorable choice as an elution buffer for antibody affinity column purifications; it is much milder on most antigens than acid elution, allowing reuse of the antigen column. Also an essential cofactor for the DNA polymerase in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Hexahydrate form also available: Magnesium Chloride, Hexahydrate",
