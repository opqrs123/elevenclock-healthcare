The mode of action of aceclofenac is largely based on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Aceclofenac is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins. The Drugs inhibits synthesis of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production.",

Similar to other bisphosphonates, alendronate has a high affinity for bone mineral and is taken up during osteoclast resorption. Alendronate inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, one of the enzymes in the mevalonic acid pathway involved in producing isoprenoid compounds that are essential for post-translational modification of small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, such as Rho, Ras and Rab. Inhibition of this process interferes with osteoclast function and survival. Alendronate is used for the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget’s disease.",

      "description": "Atorvastatin Calcium Salt is a selective and competitive HMGCR (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitor, the rate-controlling enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase results in a drastic reduction in the production of cholesterol and other isoprenoids. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase are believed to induce the expression of LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol.",

Cinnarizine was first synthesized by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1955.\n\nIt acts by interfering with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus. The disparity of signal processing between inner ear motion receptors and the visual senses is abolished, so that the confusion of brain whether the individual is moving or standing is reduced. Vomiting in motion sickness is actually a physiological compensatory mechanism of the brain to keep the individual from moving so that it can adjust to the signal perception.\n\nCinnarizine could be also viewed as a nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain. It is also effectively combined with other nootropics, primarily piracetam; in such combination each drug potentiate the other in boosting brain oxygen supply.",

Once it associates with the DNA groove, a covalent linkage forms between a DNA base and the pendant sugar of the small molecule. The intercalation into DNA blocks the replication of DNA by blocking Topo II (Topoisomerase II) This general mechanism gives it efficacy in a wide range of different cell types. Additionally, the expression of the oncogenes c-Myc and c-Jun is also down regulated by the chemical and a significant correlation was reported between the level of expression of these genes and the degree of cell growth inhibition conferred by Doxorubicin. Doxorubicin hydrochloride is an inhibitor of AMPK, TERT and POLR.",

      "description": "Glyburide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Glyburide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Glyburide appears to be completely metabolized, likely in the liver. Although its metabolites exert a small hypoglycemic effect, their contribution to glyburide’s hypoglycemic effect is thought to be clinically unimportant. Glyburide metabolites are excreted in urine and feces in approximately equal proportions. The half-life of glyburide appears to be unaffected in those with a creatinine clearance of greater than 29 ml/min/1.73m2.",

This specificity for μ-opioid receptors and limited penetrability into the brain prevent Loperamide from demonstrating central systemic effects generally associated with opiates, instead demonstrating localized action on the nociceptor and resultant antihyperalgesic action. Loperamide is shown to have an effect on the Ca2+ flux through high-voltage-activated calcium channels in response to high levels of extracellular K+, and at higher concentrations Loperamide is also a calcium channel protein inhibitor via the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-operated ion channel.",

The prexin neuron activation is associated with psychoactivation and euphoria. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although in vitro studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine.

Studies suggest that Pamidronate disodium salt stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocyte and platelet derived nitric oxide production. It is believed that this nitric oxide production can lead to a negative feedback mechanism, which could restrict the inflammatory process and reduce bone resorption. Furthermore, bisphosphonates induce endothelial cell death, cancer cell apoptosis, and nuclear factor-κB pathway activation, via the endothelial protein C receptor.",

This class of medications is comprised of inorganic pyrophosphate analogues that contain non-hydrolyzable P-C-P bonds. Similar to other bisphosphonates, alendronate has a high affinity for bone mineral and is taken up during osteoclast resorption. Alendronate inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, one of the enzymes in the mevalonic acid pathway involved in producing isoprenoid compounds that are essential for post-translational modification of small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, such as Rho, Ras and Rab. Inhibition of this process interferes with osteoclast function and survival. Alendronate is used for the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget’s disease.",

It was discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus is chemically known as a macrolide. It reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This FKBP12-FK506 complex interacts with and inhibits calcineurin thus inhibiting both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription.",

Studies suggest that Tamoxifen Citrate functions as an estrogen receptor antagonist in breast tissue. Once bound to the estrogen receptor Tamoxifen Citrate will not allow any other ligand to bind to the receptor. In contrast, Tamoxifen Citrate is an agonist towards this receptor in tissues of the endometrium. Studies indicate Tamoxifen Citrate inhibits DNA synthesis and transcription by recruiting co-repressors, which stop estrogen from interacting with genes. When combined with PAX2, Tamoxifen Citrate can inhibit the proliferation of ERBB2. It is also a high affinity activator of the GPR30 receptor. Tamoxifen Citrate is an activator of Estrogen Receptor.",

In women, testosterone is produced by the ovaries (25%), adrenals (25%) and via peripheral conversion from androstenedione (50%). Testerone in women functions to maintain libido and general wellbeing. Testosterone exerts a negative feedback mechanism on pituitary release of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

Zonisamide may be a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor although this is not one of the primary mechanisms of action. Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents, or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.",
