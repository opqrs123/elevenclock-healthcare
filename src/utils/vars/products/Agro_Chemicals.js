      "description": "Alpha cypermethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide. It is a racemic mixture of two isomers (1R Cis S and 1S Cis R isomers) out of the eight Cypermethrin isomers. It is two to three times more active than Cypermethrin under field conditions. It is effective on a wide range of insects in a variety of crops. Alphacypermethrin has contact and stomach action and can be used on cereals, cotton, fruits, vegetables, flower crops, oilseeds, sugar beet, tea, tobacco, vines, etc. for the control of a variety of insects.",

      "description": "Cypermethrin is a synthetic compound that affects the Na+ ion channels on nerve cell membranes. It is a potent PP2B (calcineurin) inhibitor (IC50~0.03 nM). It may also have varied effects on ion channels. Cypermethrin toxicology depends on the precise ratio of cis- and trans-species present in commercial mixtures - for example a mitxure of 80:20 cis-trans species shows different toxicology to a mixture of 40:60 cis-trans species. Pure isomers of Cypermethrin form a solid while a mixture of isomers of Cypermethrin form a semi-solid or liquid.",

This compound can keep the Na+ channels in an open state for a long time resulting to hyperactivity of the nervous system in mammals and insects. Deltamethrin can increase neurotransmitter release which is associated with elevated levels of intrasynaptosomal free Ca2+ and protein phosphorylation activities.",
